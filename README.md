# Energy Consumption Analysis Project

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of electricity consumption data for various appliances across different floors of a building. It includes data visualization, predictive modeling, and advanced analytics to gain insights into energy usage patterns and make future consumption predictions.

## Features

1. **Interactive Data Visualization**: Utilizes Plotly to create interactive charts for exploring energy consumption patterns by appliance and floor.

2. **Predictive Modeling**: Implements a Random Forest Regressor to predict future energy consumption based on appliance characteristics and usage patterns.

3. **Time Series Analysis**: Uses ARIMA modeling to forecast future energy consumption trends.

4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual energy consumption patterns using z-score analysis.

5. **Energy Flow Visualization**: Implements a Sankey diagram to visualize the flow of energy consumption from total to individual appliances.

6. **Heatmap Visualization**: Provides a color-coded representation of energy consumption across different appliances and floors.

## Future Improvements

1. **Machine Learning Enhancements**:
   - Experiment with more advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks for improved prediction accuracy.
   - Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.

2. **Advanced Anomaly Detection**:
   - Implement more sophisticated algorithms like Isolation Forest or DBSCAN for more accurate anomaly detection.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Develop a web-based dashboard using frameworks like Dash or Streamlit for real-time data visualization and analysis.

4. **External Data Integration**:
   - Incorporate weather data, occupancy information, or energy pricing to improve prediction accuracy and provide more context-aware insights.

5. **Energy Efficiency Recommendations**:
   - Implement an AI-driven recommendation system to suggest energy-saving measures based on the analysis results.

6. **Scalability**:
   - Optimize the code for handling larger datasets, potentially incorporating big data technologies like Apache Spark for processing massive amounts of energy consumption data.

7. **Real-time Data Processing**:
   - Implement a data pipeline for ingesting and processing real-time energy consumption data.

## Leveraging Real-time Data

Incorporating real-time data would significantly enhance this model's performance and utility:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Real-time data would allow the model to capture immediate changes in energy consumption patterns, leading to more accurate short-term predictions.

2. **Dynamic Anomaly Detection**: The system could identify and alert users to unusual consumption patterns as they occur, enabling immediate response to potential issues.

3. **Adaptive Forecasting**: With continuous data input, the time series models could adaptively update their forecasts, improving long-term prediction accuracy.

4. **Responsive Energy Management**: Real-time insights could enable dynamic energy management strategies, such as adjusting HVAC settings based on current consumption patterns and predicted future demand.

5. **User Behavior Analysis**: Continuous data could reveal patterns in user behavior and their impact on energy consumption, leading to more personalized energy-saving recommendations.

6. **Predictive Maintenance**: Real-time performance data could help predict when appliances might need maintenance, potentially preventing energy waste from malfunctioning equipment.

7. **Grid Integration**: With real-time data, the system could potentially integrate with smart grid systems, enabling more efficient energy distribution and consumption at a broader scale.

To implement real-time capabilities, consider integrating IoT devices for data collection, implementing a streaming data processing system (e.g., Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis), and developing a real-time analytics engine.
